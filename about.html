        <a>We are a small server network with a client called Fluid Client developed by DÃ¡vid#1211 (me :D).</a>
        <a>The previous owner was Quantam#2353 (815525782633709568), but we decided to remake the Discord server and
            network because of the things he had done.</a>
        <a>We aim to make our anarchy server unique by having an official kit shop, that you can buy cheap kits from
            while donating to the server.</a>
        <a>We will switch to a better hosting as soon as 20 Euros is donated, because it gives us enough money to keep
            the server alive for 3 months.</a>
